		<div class="heading1">What is Solar Eneryg?</div>
		<div class="infr">Solar energy uses the sun’s light and heat to generate renewable or ‘green’ power. The most common form of solar energy is harnessed by solar panels, or photovoltaic cells. In photovoltaic power stations, they’re arranged almost edge-to-edge to capture sunlight in large fields. You’ll also see them on top of houses and other buildings at times, as well. The cells are created from semiconductor materials. When the sun’s rays hit the cells, it loosens electrons from their atoms. This allows the electrons to flow through the cell and generate electricity.
		On a much larger scale, solar collectors can generate power for thousands of people at once. Solar-thermal power plants use a variety of techniques to produce power using the sun. The sun’s energy is used to boil water which, in turn, operates a steam turbine to generate in a similar fashion to that of coal or nuclear power plants.</div>

		<div class="heading2">Uses of Solar Eneryg?</div>
		<div class="infromation2">Our sun is the source of all life on Earth, and solar energy is useful to us in many different ways. The sun creates two main types of energy – light and heat – that we can harness for many activities ranging from photosynthesis in plants to creating electricity with photovoltaic (PV) cells to heating water and food. So, what are some uses of solar energy? Let’s explore seven common uses and benefits of sunlight in our daily lives.</div>

		<div class="heading3">Pros and Cons of Solar Energy</div>
		<div class="text2">With this article, we want to settle this squabble and finally clear the air about solar energy. Yes, there are many advantages to solar power, such as its ability to lower your carbon footprint and lessen the strain on the electrical grid. But, admittedly, solar also has its limitations, such as the inability to generate electricity at night and the difficulty of relocating solar panels once they’re installed. 

Let’s explain the principal pros and cons of this clean energy resource. We can help you decipher whether it’s worth the investment or simply educate you about this awesome power source!</div>
