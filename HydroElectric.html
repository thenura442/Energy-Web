		<div class="heading1">What is Hydo Electricity?</div></div>
		<div class="infr">Hydoelectric energy which is also known as Hydro-Electric Power or Hydroelectricity is a form of energy in which a motion of water such as water flowing over a waterfall is converted in to electricity. This Source of energy
			  is reported to be used even before modern times as historical sources suggests. People from the early Eras have used this energy from time to time for example people in Greece have used flowing water in order to turn the wheel of their mill to ground wheat flour.
			  Most hydro-electric power plants consist of a resovoir of water a gate or a valve to control the water flow out of the resovoir and an outlet from which the water flows out and downward. The water gains potential energy as it spills out of the resovoir and then the potential energy gets 
			  converted to kinetic energy as it flows down. The water then is used to turn the blades of the turbine which results in generation of electricity.</div>

		<div class="heading2">Uses of Hydro-Electric Energy?</div>
		<div class="infromation2">Similar to Wind Energy Hydopower Energy is mostly used for electricity generation and accounts for almost 20% of the total global electricity production. Hydro Power is also used for storing energy and it is called "Pumped Hydro Storage". This use is becoming more important because only a limited number of storage options are available for cheap energy storage. In the past Hydro power was also used to convert kinetic energy to mechanical energy in the agriculture sector to process grains, but this use has almost disappeared in the modern era.</div>
		<div class="list"><ul>
 											 <li>Electricity - Hydroelectricity using resovoirs.</li>
											 <li>Energy Storage - Pumped Hydro Storage.</li>
  											 <li>Load Balancing - Storing Power usage and low using periods while generating power at high usage periods.</li>
  											 <li>Accomodation of Intermittent Sources of Energy. </li>
  											 <li>Agriculture - processing grains, sawing timber and stone, raising water into irrigation canals etc.</li>
  											 <li>Industry - Driving bellows in small blast furnaces extraction of metal ores in a method called hushing.</li>

		<div class="heading3">Pros and Cons of Hydro-Electric Energy</div>
		<div class="text2">Hydroelectricity is classified as a renewable energy source. Why? Basically because water vapourizes into the clouds and is delivered to the earth through rain. This Cycle Keeps repeating so the energy can be utilized to generate electricity over and over again. Hydro-Electric power simply means generation of power falling or streaming water, although producing od energy using Hydro Power doesn not emit and greenhouse gases, the building of huge dams on rivers blocking them can have serious environmental and social effectssuch as altering the normal flow of water resulting in blocking migratory fish passage, increase in the number of earthquakes and sudden occurences of floods etc. 

Let’s take a look at the pros and cons of this clean energy resource. We can help you decipher whether it’s worth the investment or simply educate you about the awesome power it holds</div>
