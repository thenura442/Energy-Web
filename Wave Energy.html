		<div class="infr"> The conveyance and collection of energy by ocean surface waves is known as wave energy .
			 The captured energy is subsequently used for a variety of tasks, including electricity generation water desalination 
			 and water pumping. Wave energy is a sort of renewable energy that is projected to be the world's largest ocean energy resource.
		 Wave energy is produced using a variety of technologies. Absorbers attenuators oscillation water columns overtopping and the
		  inverted-pendulum device are the five primary types of technology used.With a buoy abosorbers harvest energy from the rise and
		   fall of the waves. After the energy is retrieved a linear or rotary generator is used to convert it to electrical energy.</div>

		<div class="heading2">Uses of Wave Eneryg?</div>
		<div class="infromation2"> Wave energy has enormous potential since the energy in a single wave is extremely concentrated, 
			implying that a single wave can deliver a significant amount of energy. If we can properly harness wave energy, we could 
			provide over 40% of the world's energy demands — equivalent to the output of over 800 nuclear power plants! Wave energy
			 does not require the use of land (as wind energy does) or sunshine (as solar energy does), and it is quite inexpensive.
			Those massive waves. What are their origins? What triggered them? All that water slamming onto the shore appears to be
			 the result of some serious force. Wind blowing across open water creates waves, which provide wave energy. That waterpower
			  is an important source of energy. Despite the fact that wave energy has proven difficult to harvest successfully and 
			  economically, the globe is suddenly interested in it.</div>

		<div class="heading3">Pros and Cons of Wave Energy</div>
		<div class="text2"> Ocean waves generate enormous amounts of energy, which can be harnessed as wave energy or tidal energy,
			 a renewable resource. Ocean energy has the potential to create 2.64 trillion kilowatt hours in the United States. 
			 Which is more than half of the energy produced in the country in 2018.	What if we had the ability to generate more 
			 than half of the nation's electricity from waves.
