		<div class="infr">Biomass energy is energy generated or produced by living or once-living organisms. Since the earliest cave men first made wood fires for cooking and keeping warm. Later people use biomass energy for the different purposes. At the household level some people are use biomass energy for their cooking purposes by converting to biogases. Most of the countries taken steps to generate power and energy by using renewable energy. Biomass also know as renewable energy source. Therefore, if country uses biomass energy as their energy source, they can reduce the environmental impacts and production cost of the energy.</div>

		<div class="heading2">Uses of Biomass Eneryg</div>
		<div class="infromation2">Fossil fuels such as crude oil and coal are the most prominent primary energy sources in the world. Still, the firewood and plant components supply a significant portion of the world’s energy requirement.One of the methods of producing biomass energy is by using garbage which can be easily collected anywhere of the country. The energy demand is increasing day by day, hence different source of energy needs to be identified to fulfill the demand. Therefore, usage of biomass energy is important for every country.</div>
